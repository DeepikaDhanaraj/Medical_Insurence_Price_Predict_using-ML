## Medical Insurance Price Prediction using Machine Learning â€“ Python
Design and implement a machine learning (ML) solution to accurately predict the prices of medical insurance premiums for individuals based on their demographic, lifestyle, and health-related characteristics. The primary objective is to develop a robust model that leverages historical insurance data to forecast insurance costs with high precision and reliability.

##Objective

The model should incorporate features such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, pre-existing conditions, geographic location, and family medical history to generate personalized insurance premium estimates. The proposed ML system aims to assist insurance companies in optimizing pricing strategies, enhancing risk assessment processes, and providing more transparent and fair insurance premiums to customers.
